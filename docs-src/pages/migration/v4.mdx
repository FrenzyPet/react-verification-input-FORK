# Migrating to Version 4

This guide is aimed at developers wanting to update from `v3.x.x` to `v4.x.x`.

Check the following steps one by one and execute the ones that apply to your
situation.

## Removed Wrapper Element

The wrapper element with the class name `.vi_wrapper` was removed. It was inconvenient to style this element with frameworks like Tailwind, since it was not possible to set custom class names. Instead the `.vi_wrapper` class had to be overridden in a CSS file. 

If you currently rely on this class, this change might break your styling. Styles from the wrapper element should probably be moved to the container element in version 4.

```jsx
// v3
<style>
.vi_wrapper {
  // your custom styles
}
</style>

<VerificationInput />

// v4
<VerificationInput classNames={{ container: "custom-class-names" }} />
```
