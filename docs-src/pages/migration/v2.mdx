# Migrating to Version 2

This guide is aimed at developers wanting to update from `v0.1.x` to `v2.x.x`.

Check the following steps one by one and execute the ones that apply to your
situation.

## Rename prop: `input`

The `input` prop has been renamed to `inputProps` in order to be more explicit
about the props being forwarded to the input element. Also, the `onChange`
callback is now available on the top level. This matches the interface of a
regular input element more closely (there is also a new top-level prop
`value`).

```jsx
// v0.1.x
<VerificationInput
  input={{
    type: "tel",
    value={code}
    onChange={handleCodeChange}
  }}
/>

// v2
<VerificationInput
  inputProps={{
    type: "tel",
  }}
  value={code}
  onChange={handleCodeChange}
/>
```

## Remove props: `container`, `inputField`, `characters`, `character`

These props have been removed. Your custom CSS classes can be passed to the
new `classNames` prop. In order to simplify the component structure, the
`characters` element has been removed, use `container` instead. For more
details see [Styling](/styling). Additional props can no longer be forwarded
to these elements.

```jsx
// v0.1.x
<VerificationInput
  container={{
    className: 'container',
  }}
  characters={{
    className: 'characters',
  }}
  character={{
    className: 'character',
  }}
/>

// v2
<VerificationInput
  classNames={{
    container: "container",
    character: "character",
  }}
/>
```

## Remove prop: `getInputRef`

This callback has been removed. The new way to receive the input ref is to use
the [standard `ref` prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html). The
result will be a ref to the actual (invisible) input element.

```jsx
// v0.1.x
<VerificationInput
  getInputRef={ref => {myRef = ref}}
/>

// v2
<VerificationInput
  ref={myRef}
/>
```
