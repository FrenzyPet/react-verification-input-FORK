# Migrating to Version 3

This guide is aimed at developers wanting to update from `v2.x.x` to `v3.x.x`.

Check the following steps one by one and execute the ones that apply to your
situation.

## New prop: `containerProps`

Custom props are no longer forwarded to the container element. Use the new
prop `containerProps` instead and specify the custom props in object literal
form.

```jsx
// v2
<VerificationInput
  id="input-container"
/>

// v3
<VerificationInput
  containerProps={{
    id: "input-container"
  }}
/>
```

## Remove prop: `removeDefaultStyles`

The `removeDefaultStyles` prop has been removed. Styles are now overridable by
default. Thus this prop can be removed safely.

```jsx
// v2
<VerificationInput
  removeDefaultStyles
  classNames={{
    character: "character"
  }}
/>

// v3
<VerificationInput
  classNames={{
    character: "character"
  }}
/>
```
